## Garden Variety IoT with Big Data and FRP

I've been turning my home into an IoT (Internet of Things) lab lately. My livingroom white leds enhance the light coming from outside, based on an algorithm that depends on lightness outside. The other lights turn on automatically if I'm there when the night gets dark and I forgot to turn them on myself (happens often). The air humidifier in my bedroom is regulated with an external humidity sensor and an algorithm that keeps the humidity between healthy limits. I've been telling myself and my spouse that I'm doing this to make living easier but I guess I can admit that I do it mostly just because I can and I enjoy the tweaking itself. What's cool and what I want to talk about though is how nicely the FRP (functional reactive programming) is suited for home automation.

For instance, yesterday I put the fountain in my garden under automatic control. It will only run when someone’s home, it’s daytime and obviously, as I live in Finland, when it’s not freezing outside.

I integrated my fountain pump into my home automation system this with this piece of code (I'll explain it later):

```coffeescript
outdoorTempP = sensors.sensorP({type:"temperature", location: "outdoor"})
dayTimeP = time.hourOfDayP.map((hours) -> hours >= 6 || hours <= 22)
freezingP = outdoorTempP.map((t) -> t < 0)
someoneHomeP = motion.occupiedP("livingroom", time.oneHour * 8)
fountainP = dayTimeP.and(freezingP.not()).and(someoneHomeP)
houm.controlLight "fountain", fountainP
````

This is possible because I’ve already installed some sensors around my house, measuring things like temperature, 
humidity and lightness here and there. Some sensors I've bought and many have I soldered together from stuff like ESP-8266 WiFi microcontrollers, Raspberry Pis and numerous sensor modules. I’ve even designed a printed circuit board that has motion detection and a bunch of measurements, and ordered the manufacturing of 10 units from China. Looks like this:

Also, I have the [Huom.IO](http://houm.io/en/) lighting control system set up, that allows me to turn 
lights and actually any electric appliances on and off using a simple [API](https://github.com/houmio/houmio-docs/blob/master/apidoc.md).

Because I’m an FRP nerd and happen to have built a [FRP library](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/) of my own a few years ago,
I want to do my automation by combining streams of data using FRP operators like `map`, `flatMap` and `combine`. So I wrote a simple server (link) platform that allows me to gather the data from my sensors and lighting system and pipe and combine it to control my lighting. And, of course, the fountain.

### Introduction to FRP IoT: Combining Properties

For me, home automation and IoT is about collecting streams of measurement values, storing them for later use and visualization, transforming and combining this data into control streams that can then be fed to actuators such as lighting, pumps and valves. To me, FRP with a library like Bacon.js seems like the perfect fit.

In Bacon.js, we use `EventStreams` to represent distinct events and `Properties` to represent values that change over time. For instance, in my home automation platform, there's an API called `sensors` that will give me any measured value as a Property. So, when I write

```coffeescript
outdoorTempP = sensors.sensorP({type:"temperature", location: "outdoor"})
outdoorTempP.forEach((t) -> console.log("temperature is " + t)
````

... my function on line 2 will be called when the outside temperature property `outdoorTempP` changes and the temperature will be written to standard output. Not very useful yet, but let's add more stuff.

```coffeescript
freezingP = outdoorTempP.map((t) -> t < 0)
dayTimeP = time.hourOfDayP.map((hours) -> hours >= 6 || hours <= 22)
````

Here I've used the `map` method of `outdoorTempP` to transform the temperature values into boolean values so that the new property `freezingP` will hold `true` when temperature outside is freezing (I'm obviously using Celsius degrees here). Then I added a new property `dayTimeP` using a similar `map` call on the `hourOfDayP` property of the `time` API.

Finally, I add one more property from the `motion` API and combine all of the data using boolean logic:

```coffeescript
someoneHomeP = motion.occupiedP("livingroom", time.oneHour * 8)
fountainP = dayTimeP.and(freezingP.not()).and(someoneHomeP)
```

So the final `fountainP` property will hold `true` when it's daytime, not freezing and someone's home. The last line that uses the `and` and `not` operators could also be written with the more generic `combineWith` operator that let's you combine the latest values of a bunch of Properties using a function. Like this:

```coffeescript
fountainP = Bacon.combineWith(dayTimeP, freezingP, someoneHomeP, (daytime, freezing, atHome) ->
  daytime && atHome && !freezing
```

Admittedly my "someone home" property is not very accurate, as it's based on whether there's been motion in the livingroom in the last 8 hours. I'll add an outdoor motion sensor later for more accuracy, but this will do for now. It's not fatal to have a fountain running even when I'm not home. But at least it won't be running when I'm on a 2-week vacation in Africa. During which my home automation system will, by the way, give the impression of an occupied house by turning lights on and off every now and then.

Anyways, now that I've defined when the fountain should be running, I can actually make it obey my will by using my reactive HOUM.IO API wrapper:

```coffeescript
houm.controlLight "fountain", fountainP
````

### The time axis

FRP is not just great for combining the current values of a bunch of Properties. It really shines also when you have to deal with time. Like

  "Turn off lights if there's no activity in 2 hours"
  
You can express this with this code

```coffeescript
  # motionP holds 1 when there's motion and 0 when there's no motion
  motionP = sensors.sensorP({type: "motion", location: "livingroom"})
  # motionE emits an event when motionP changes from 0 to 1
  motionE = motionP.changes().filter((m) -> m == 1)
  # inactiveE emits an event with value zero after 2 hours of inactivity
  inactiveE = motionE.debounce(time.oneHour * 2).map(0)
  # sets livingroom brightness to zero when inactiveE emits an event
  inactiveE.forEach(houm.setLight("livingroom"))
```

In fact, libraries like Bacon.js and RxJs are packed full of operators that you can do to achieve any kind of effect on the time axis with declarative, functional code.

### My IoT Platform

My [Homegrown Reactive IoT Platform](https://github.com/raimohanska/sensor-server) currently has these API's:

- `houm` for controlling lighting and electric appliances
- `time` for time-of-day related EventStreams and Properties
- `sun` for sunrise/sunset information and sun brightness in my (or your) location
- `sensors` for sensor input data (temperature, humidity, etc). Data is fed through TCP and HTTP endpoints using JSON
- `motion` motion sensor data, room occupied indication with throttling. Built on the `sensors` API

The platform is not quite documented yet, but I can write some docs if there's interest. Please add a Star and create an Issue if you're interested in more information!
