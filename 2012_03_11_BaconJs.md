Bacon.js
========

In my previous posting I ranted a bit about the WTFs related to RxJs
hot and cold Observables and didn't come up with a very good workaround.

This time I have one. Use [Bacon.js](https://github.com/raimohanska/bacon.js).
That would be my homemade reactive library for Javascript. It solves the
hot/cold problem by replacing Observable with two distinct abstractions:

- EventStream which is a stream of events. As in consistent stream with
  no bullshit like different state for different subscribers
- Property which is a stateful property. Like a stream with current
  value. Any new subscriber will immediately be called back with the
  current value if there is any.

I'll use my earlier game development examples again, converted into
bacon.js, to show how the new library works. I assume some RxJs knowhow.

So if you have some events (say keyboard events) and you want to map
them into some domain events (like game character movement), you can
start with the source events and use `map`, `filter` and `merge`.  
The following functions allow you to create a keyUp or keyDown
stream for a given keyCode.

    var allKeyUps = $(document).asEventStream("keyup")
    var allKeyDowns = $(document).asEventStream("keydown")

    function always(value) { return function(_) { return value } }
    function keyCodeIs(keyCode) { return function(event) { return event.keyCode == keyCode} }
    function keyUps(keyCode) { return allKeyUps.filter(keyCodeIs(keyCode)) }
    function keyDowns(keyCode) { return allKeyDowns.filter(keyCodeIs(keyCode)) }

When you want to accumulate some state (like player position), 
you can use `toProperty` or `scan` to get a stateful Property. These
things have a meaningful "current value", unlike streams like "keyup events".

The following creates keyState property from
keyups and keydowns of each arrow key, then combines them into a single
"direction" property usin `toProperty`:

    function concat(a1, a2) {
      return a1.concat(a2)
    }
    function keyState(keyCode, value) {
      return keyDowns(keyCode).map(always([value])).
        merge(keyUps(keyCode).map(always([]))).toProperty([])
    }
    var direction = keyState(38, new Vector2D(0, -1))
      .combine(keyState(40, new Vector2D(0, 1)), concat)
      .combine(keyState(37, new Vector2D(-1, 0)), concat)
      .combine(keyState(39, new Vector2D(1, 0)), concat)
      .map(head)

The direction property will start with the empty array []. When you
press an arrow key, the value will change to an array containing the
corresponding direction vector. The `combine` method of Property is used
to combine multiple properties into one.

The `Property.sample` method can be used to sample the current value of
a Property each 50 milliseconds. The result will be an EventStream,
because these are now distincts events (no current value, see?). So if
you sample the direction each 50 milliseconds, you'll get a "movements"
stream:

    var startPos = new Vector2D(50, 50)

    function head(array) { return array[0] }
    function id(x) { return x }

    var movements = direction.sample(50).filter(id)

Now we can further accumulate the movements into the current position:

    var position = movements
      .scan(startPos, function(pos, move) { return pos.add(move) })

And voila, we are able to control our game character with the keyboard.

For a live demo of the same, see my [slideshow](http://raimohanska.github.com/bacon.js-slides), especially the [last
slide](http://raimohanska.github.com/bacon.js-slides/6.html).

Bacon.js has quite good test coverage, it's open-source, it has at least
some level of documentation and I'm a nice guy, so please try it out and
let me know how the Bacon suits you.

All help is also appreciated also, so please contribute.
