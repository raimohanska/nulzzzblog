## Daddy, what does the "new" keyword do?

Sit down, and I'll tell you. Ok, it creates a new context object for
you, then you'll have a new `this` to work with. This object will be the
return value of the expression starting with `new`. For example,

    > function Dog() { this.name = "poo" }
    undefined
    > new Dog().name
    'poo'

> But daddy, what happens if you accidentally forget to use `new`?

Um, er, lemme see.

    > Dog().name
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined

So, your constructor gets called, but nothing is returned and your Dog
is `undefined`. 

> But what happened to the name? 

Well, it's the name of the `Window` or what ever your "global object" is, depending on your
execution environment. But its bed time now, good night.

Well, if you call it with `new`, the return value is discarded. If you
forget the `new`, the expression evaluates to the return value.

That's right, son. That's why daddy avoids the `new` and `this` keywords. Now good night.
