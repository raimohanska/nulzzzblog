# Bacon.js 0.7 coming up!

## Glitch-free FRP [#272](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/issues/272)

The main goal of the 0.7.0 release is to make FRP with Bacon.js
essentially glitch-free. And this is the most invasive change into Bacon.js 
internals for quite a while.

Let's start with the problem that I'm trying to solve her. A glitch in FRP is
a temporary violation of an invariant that, with bacon.js at least, occurs when 
simultaneous events are involved. And just to be precise, my definition for simultaneous
events is *events that have the same root event*. So, for instance, a stream `a` and its
descendant `a.map((x) -> x * 2)` produce simultaneous events by this definition,
while `a = Bacon.later(1)` and `b = Bacon.later(1)` do not.

The exec summary of this improvement is that 0.7.0 is more reliable.

But if you're intrested in the details, read on! For instance, if you use Bacon.js 0.6.x and run this

```coffeescript
a = Bacon.sequentially(10, [1, 2])
b = a.map((x) -> x * 2)
c = Bacon.combineAsArray([a, b])
c.log()
```

You'll get

    [ 1, 2 ]
    [ 2, 2 ]
    [ 2, 4 ]

where the pair `[2,2]` is a glitch that occurs because `c` is updated first by the changed value of `a` and the the changed value of `b`. In glitch-free FRP you should get just

    [ 1, 2 ]
    [ 2, 4 ]

Since 0.4.0, Bacon.js has featured "atomic updates", but that has beed quite limited, because they only apply to a graph of Properties. The above example fails in pre-0.7.0 because of this limitation. In this example, the problem could be worked-around by making `a` a property as in

```coffeescript
a = Bacon.sequentially(10, [1, 2]).toProperty()
```

But there are more complex cases that are harder to work-around. Like if you have a complex graph of Properties that you combine using `combineWith(a, b, f)`, the pre-0.7.0 system doesn't guarantee that your combinator function `f` won't be called for some invalid intermediate pairs of values when the sources `a` and `b` occur simultaneously.

And then there are `takeUntil` and `skipUntil`. Previously the functioning of these 
combinators has depended on subscription order. For example, the correct functioning of
`a.takeUntil(b)` in case of simultaneous events from sources `a` and `b` has depended on
that the event from b gets in first. And it did in most cases but not always. There's a new
test case (look for the word "evil") that fails for pre-0.7.0 versions.

How did I solve this? Simply using a dependency-graph. Now all Observables have a list of "deps". For instance, if you run

```coffeescript
Bacon = require("../src/Bacon")

a = Bacon.constant("a")
b = Bacon.constant("b")
c = Bacon.combineAsArray([a, b])

console.log("deps of c:", c.deps().map((s) -> s.toString()))
```

You'll get

    deps of c: [ 'Bacon.constant(a)', 'Bacon.constant(b)' ]

So now, using this new dependency information, it's possible to hold the output of any combined Observable until all of its deps are ready. And that's how it works.

## Observable.toString [#265](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/issues/265)

As you might have spotted above, there's now a rather nice `toString` method for all Observables.
The output of this method resembles very closely to the code that was used to create the Observable.
For instance

```coffeescript
coffee> Bacon.constant(false).and(Bacon.constant(true)).toString()
'Bacon.constant(false).and(Bacon.constant(true))'

coffee> Bacon.combineTemplate({ name: Bacon.constant("bacon.js"), version: Bacon.constant("0.7.0")}).toString()
'Bacon.combineTemplate([object Object])'
```

TODO: combineTemplate not looking nice!
